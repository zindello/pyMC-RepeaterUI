# pyMC Repeater UI

Web dashboard for [pyMC_Repeater](https://github.com/pymc-dev/pyMC_Repeater) — monitor and manage your pyMc repeater entirely from the browser.

Built with **Vue 3**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**. This repository holds the standalone UI source; it builds directly into the repeater project and is served by its embedded web server. Keeping the frontend separate keeps the repeater codebase lean and makes UI contributions easier.

## Documentation

Developer reference for the frontend is in [`docs/`](docs/README.md). It covers the data service architecture, design token system, shared UI components, z-index layering scale, and architecture decision records for significant design choices.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome — please target the **dev** branch.

## Features

- **Dashboard** — real-time stats, packet charts, and airtime utilisation at a glance
- **Neighbors** — interactive network map (Leaflet) with signal-quality indicators and a sortable neighbor table
- **Terminal** — full xterm.js console backed by a command registry (status, identities, keys, neighbors, ACL, rooms, and more)
- **Configuration** — radio settings, duty cycle, transport keys, web settings, LetsMesh, backup/restore, API tokens, and advert management
- **Sessions & Companions** — view and manage active sessions and companion devices
- **Statistics & Logs** — historical packet data, system metrics, and a searchable log viewer
- **Room Servers** — overview of connected room servers
- **CAD Calibration** — channel-activity-detection tuning tools
- **Real-time updates** — WebSocket packet feed with automatic reconnection
- **Authentication** — JWT-based login with token refresh and a guided first-boot setup wizard

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20 or later
- A running [pyMC_Repeater](https://github.com/pymc-dev/pyMC_Repeater) backend

## Quick Start

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # point VITE_DEV_API_URL at your backend
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/auth` requests to the URL set in `VITE_DEV_API_URL`.

## Production Build

```sh
npm run build
```

The compiled output is written to `../pyMC_Repeater/repeater/web/html` and served directly by the repeater.
